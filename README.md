A comprehensive Hospital Management System developed to efficiently manage patient records, appointments, and other essential hospital services. This project demonstrates the application of data structures in real-world scenarios within healthcare management.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Patient Management**: Efficient registration and management of patient records using linked lists.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Streamlined appointment organization with doctors using queues.
- **Medical History Tracking**: Maintain and track patients' medical histories and prescriptions.
- **Undo/Redo Actions**: Action history for medical record editing through stacks.
- **Fast Lookup**: Quick retrieval of patients and medical staff by unique IDs using hash tables.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access for medical staff (doctors, nurses, and admin) to ensure data privacy.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- **Frontend**: C with GTK for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: PHP for the API and database interactions.
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB for managing hospital records.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, queues, stacks, and hash tables for efficient data management.
- **Data Exchange**: JSON and AJAX for real-time communication between the front end and back end.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- GCC compiler for C
